This app visualizes the monthly global land-surface temperature from 1753 - 2015 as a rectangular heat map. Each node in the dataset is represented by a vertical, rectangular cell, positioned by month along the y-axis and by year along the x-axis. Cells are color coded according to the deviation of the land-surface temperature (celsius) relative to the Jan 1951 - Dec 1980 average (8.66 C), ranging from shades of blue to shades of red.
